   <h2>Machines</h2>
   <p>Susitna shows 64 cores but I think the real machine has only 16 nodes in total.</p>
   <p>DCC is a machine in Portugal that has 24 real cores.</p>
   <h2>Experiments</h2>
   <ol>
      <li><a href="bench_101314/index.html">10/13/2014 Benchmarks</a> Compares machine DCC with Susitna, imm means facts are added to the node as soon as they are derived while buffer means facts are buffered and then sent as a vector once the node executes all rules. We compare two stealing strategies: steal one (steal one node per attempt) and steal half (steal half of the nodes per attempt).</li>
      <li><a href="bench_101414/index.html">10/14/2014 Benchmarks</a> Compares different spinlock implementations: atomic (simple atomic flag), ticket and queued lock.</li>
