      <li><a href="bench_101314/index.html">10/13/2014 Benchmarks</a> Compares machine DCC with Susitna, imm means facts are added to the node as soon as they are derived while buffer means facts are buffered and then sent as a vector once the node executes all rules. We compare two stealing strategies: steal one (steal one node per attempt) and steal half (steal half of the nodes per attempt).</li>
